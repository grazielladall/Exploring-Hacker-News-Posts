# Exploring Hacker News Posts
This project is intended to show skills such as:

The project is about Hacker News posts. Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (known as 'posts') receive votes and comments. It is widely used among the technology and startup community, with highest voted posts reaching hundreds of thousands of users.

The main objective of the project is to answer the following questions:

* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
